#### What have you accomplished so far?

- You first installed the Amplify Command Line Interface and configured your profile right at the console.
- You then initialized a new Amplify backend project on the command line which creates packages and dependencies right at the root of the TravelBuddy project.
- You then configured Amplify on the client with a few import statements to our `src/App.js` file.
- You then added User Authentication with Amazon Cognito with the help of the AWS Amplify CLI with `withAuthenticator`.
- On the challenge exercise, you incorporated a custom Sign In / Sign Up form by directly calling the `Auth` Class methods.
