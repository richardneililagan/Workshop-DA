For this lab, the files that make up the TravelBuddy application have been provided for you so you can focus on learning about the deployment process, rather than building the application from scratch. 

The application is a simple modern web application built with ReactJS but you will learn the concepts to integrate features of User Authentication, Chatbot and Storage capabilities with AWS Amplify as we proceed with the program.

In this task, you will download the application bundle and store it on your local workstation.

1. Right click this link: [TravelBuddy.zip](./files/TravelBuddy.zip) and select copy link address.

2. Open a browser in your workspace and paste that copied link in the address bar of the browser to download the files.

3. Extract the downloaded **TravelBuddy.zip** file to a work area. Later you will use the files in the archive. The extracted archive will be referred to as the *project* in the rest of this workshop.
