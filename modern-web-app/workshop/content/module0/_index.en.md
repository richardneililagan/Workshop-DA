Welcome to the first module in this workshop! This module involves getting access to a developer environment that we've provisioned for you. The developer environment contains all the software and network access required to get you up and running with the labs in record time. 

We've chosen to do this as the main aim for this workshop is learning the content in each module, not setting up your local machines. It also provides a consistent environment between you and your fellow colleagues to eliminate the weird "works on my machine" behavior.

If you were planning on running this lab on your own machine, you'll have to adapt the instructions accordingly. Make sure to manually install the software listed in the **Development Environment** section below.

### Topics Covered

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Connect to a running windows instance

### Development Environment
A fully fledged development environment has already been created for you with the following resources installed:

- VSCode IDE for Web Developers
- Node Package Manager (npm) CLI
- AWS Amplify CLI
- AWS CLI
