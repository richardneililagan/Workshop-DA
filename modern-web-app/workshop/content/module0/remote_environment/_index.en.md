Your initial interaction with AWS will be via the AWS Console, a web-based window into your AWS account and the resources within it. 

These labs are designed to work with Event engine, our workshop provisioning tool. You should have already been provided with an Event engine hash key to login to your provisioned account by your workshop instructor. 
Please reach out to your workshop instructor if you haven't received your hash key before continuing this lab.
