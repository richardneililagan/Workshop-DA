#### Install and configure the AWS Command Line tools

In this task you will install and configure the AWS CLI. Even if you have already installed the AWS CLI, it is worth making sure you have the latest version as this tool gets updated frequently to support the pace of change in the AWS platform.

1. The configuration of credentials for the AWS CLI depends on whether you are using your own AWS account and IAM user, or if you are using an AWS-provided account. Please select which option you would like to choose.
